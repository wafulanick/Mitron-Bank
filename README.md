No - Occupation is not a determinant of where the money is spent given that regardless of the Occupation, the top three categories where money is spent are Bill, Groceries, and Electronics regardless of the occupation with which the customer is in.

YES – Gender determines where the amount is spent. For the females, their top 4 priorities are Health and Wellness, Bills, Travel, and Groceries.  However, for the males, their top 4 priorities are Bills, Groceries, Electronics, and Travel.

NOTE – The all the Males' top 4 priorities eclipse the top category where the females spend their money. 


The areas that the females prioritize seem like an untapped gold mine, and therefore, we recommend exploring these areas. The areas have potential for more revenue generation and hence, venturing more to it can prove productive to the business. For the males, we recommend venturing more to the home products that are geared towards household bills, groceries, electronics, and travel

# Is the city a determinant of where money is spent?

NO – City is not a factor that determines where money is spent. 

NOTE- All the top 4 categories where money is spent are similar across all the cities. The categories are Bills, Groceries, Electronics, and Health & Wellness.

YES – Age group is a determinant of where money is spent. Here, Age_group 21-24 prioritizes Entertainment, Electronic, Apparel, and Food as their top 4 categories where they spend money. Age_group 25-34 prioritizes Bills, Groceries, Electronics, and Travel as their top 4 categories where money is spent. Age_group 35-45 prioritizes Bills, Groceries, Health & Wellness, and Electronics as their top 4 categories. The 45+ category prioritizes Bills, Groceries, Health & Wellness, and Travel as their top 4 categories where money is spent. The difference across the age groups is stark, and so yes, Age_group is a factor.

# Recommendation: 

We recommend focusing on the top products prioritized by each age group to maximize sales

The difference in the top priorities show that indeed marriage status is a determinant on where money is spent.
